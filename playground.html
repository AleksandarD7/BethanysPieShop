        <h3> Our History</h3>
            For countless years, Bethany's passion for crafting the most scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. 
            Our journey began in 2013 when we unveiled our first charming store in the heart of Brussels (Belgium), 
            nestled in a cozy little street near the illustrious Grand Market.
